# Assignment 1
In this assignment, I collected data on the number of elevator arrivals in the CDS building over a short timespan of 5 minutes. Using everyone's data, I drew charts and conclusions as to whether we can come up with a position to wait in that minimizes walking distance to the next arriving elevator.
