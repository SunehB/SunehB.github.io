# Assignment 1
In this assignment, I collected data on the number of elevator arrivals in the CDS building over a short timespan of 5 minutes. Using everyone's data, I drew charts and conclusions as to whether we can come up with a position to wait in that minimizes walking distance to the next arriving elevator.

# Assignment 2
In this project, I implemented a KMeans clustering algorithm from scratch and created a web-based application using Flask. The application allows users to visualize the clustering process interactively, offering various initialization methods and options to run the algorithm either to convergence or step through the iterations. This tool enhances understanding of KMeans and provides a platform for users to experiment with different datasets and parameters, fostering a deeper grasp of clustering concepts in data science.

# Assignment 3
In this assignment, I applied Singular Value Decomposition to the MNIST data set, exploring how it can impact a logistic regression model. We reduce the dataset to various numbers of components, retaining the most important features from the data, and compare the model's accuracy and training time for different component levels.

# Assignment 4
In this project, I developed an interactive search engine using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and built a web application with Flask. The application allows users to query a set of documents and retrieve the top five most relevant documents based on cosine similarity. It performs dimensionality reduction using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on a term-document matrix and visualizes the similarity scores of the top results in a bar chart. This project provides an accessible way to explore LSA, understand document similarity, and experiment with information retrieval techniques in natural language processing.
