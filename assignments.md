# Assignment 1
In this assignment, I collected data on the number of elevator arrivals in the CDS building over a short timespan of 5 minutes. Using everyone's data, I drew charts and conclusions as to whether we can come up with a position to wait in that minimizes walking distance to the next arriving elevator.

# Assignment 2
In this project, I implemented a KMeans clustering algorithm from scratch and created a web-based application using Flask. The application allows users to visualize the clustering process interactively, offering various initialization methods and options to run the algorithm either to convergence or step through the iterations. This tool enhances understanding of KMeans and provides a platform for users to experiment with different datasets and parameters, fostering a deeper grasp of clustering concepts in data science.
